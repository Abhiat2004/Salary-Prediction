# Salary-Prediction
Predicting salary is an essential task in human resources and talent management. Organizations often rely on predictive models to determine competitive salary packages that attract and retain the best talent. One powerful approach to salary prediction is to use polynomial regression.
## Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a polynomial equation. In the context of salary prediction, the dependent variable is the salary, while the independent variable(s) can be factors like experience, education, location, and job role.
## Data Preparation
To train a polynomial regressor model for salary prediction, you need a high-quality dataset that contains historical salary information along with corresponding features. This dataset should include variables like years of experience, education level, job role, and gender e.t.c.
## Choose the Degree of the Polynomial
The first step in training a polynomial regressor model is to select the degree of the polynomial equation. This degree represents the highest power of the independent variable(s) in the equation. A higher degree allows the model to capture more complex relationships but can lead to overfitting.
## Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared (RÂ²). These metrics indicate how well the model fits the data and how accurate its predictions are.
## Conclusion
Training a polynomial regressor model for salary prediction is a valuable tool for organizations looking to optimize their compensation strategies and attract top talent. With the right dataset, data preparation, feature selection, and model training, this approach can provide accurate salary estimates for job candidates and current employees. It's an essential asset for businesses seeking to remain competitive in today's job market.
